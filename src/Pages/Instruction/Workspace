                that stretches the entire body, builds strength, and improves circulation. To perform
                the pose, start in a tabletop position with your hands and knees on the ground, then
                lift your hips up and back while straightening your arms and legs.

              Padmasana, also known as Lotus Pose, is a seated yoga posture that is commonly used for meditation and pranayama (breathing exercises). It is a challenging pose that requires flexibility in the hips and knees. To perform the pose, start in a seated position with your legs extended in front of you, then bend one knee and place your foot on the opposite thigh. Repeat with the other leg, bringing both feet to rest on the opposite thighs.

              Utkatasana, also known as Chair Pose, is a standing yoga posture that strengthens the thighs and calves, stretches the shoulders and chest, and stimulates the heart and diaphragm. To perform the pose, start in a standing position with your feet together, then bend your knees and lower your hips as if you are sitting in an imaginary chair. Raise your arms overhead and hold the pose for several breaths.

              Utthita Trikonasana, also known as Extended Triangle Pose, is a standing yoga posture that stretches the hips, hamstrings, and spine, and strengthens the legs and ankles. To perform the pose, start in a standing position with your feet about three to four feet apart, then turn your right foot out to a 90-degree angle and your left foot in slightly. Reach your right arm down and place your hand on your right shin, ankle, or the floor outside your right foot. Stretch your left arm up towards the ceiling and gaze up at your left hand.

              Vrikshasana, also known as Tree Pose, is a standing yoga posture that improves balance and stability, strengthens the legs, and stretches the hips and thighs. To perform the pose, start in a standing position with your feet together, then shift your weight onto your left foot and place your right foot on the inside of your left thigh. Press your foot into your thigh and bring your hands together in front of your heart. Hold the pose for several breaths before switching sides.
